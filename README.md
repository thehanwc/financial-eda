*An Exploratory Data Analysis and Business Intelligence Case Study*

---

## Overview

This repository contains the **core exploratory analysis, data preparation logic, and business intelligence artifacts** developed using the **Power BI Financial Sample dataset**.

This project represents the **author’s individual analytical work**, focusing on:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand financial performance drivers.
- **Data cleaning and transformation logic** implemented in Python.
- **Business-oriented visualization and storytelling** through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Together, these components form a **complete EDA-to-visualization pipeline**, demonstrating how raw financial data can be transformed into actionable business insights.

## Why This Project Is Useful

In practical data analytics and business intelligence roles, value is created not by models alone, but by the ability to:

- Understand data structure and limitations  
- Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies  
- Translate analysis into insights that support decision-making  

This project demonstrates those competencies through a **structured, end-to-end EDA workflow**:

- **Systematic Data Exploration** – Clear separation of categorical and numerical feature analysis.
- **Robust Data Cleaning** – Normalization of monetary values, handling of placeholders, and consistency checks.
- **Business-Driven Analysis** – Focus on profitability, discount effects, and segment-level performance.
- **Executive-Level Visualization** – Presentation of insights through a Power BI dashboard designed for stakeholders.

The result is a **portfolio-ready analytics case study** aligned with real-world expectations for data analyst and BI roles.
